# Titanic-classifier
This project, developed during my internship at Bharat Intern, involves building a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. Utilizing historical data, the classifier aims to provide insights and improve prediction accuracy through various data analysis and modeling techniques.
